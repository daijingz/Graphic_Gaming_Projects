# OpenGL-Image-Rendering
C++ project with OpenGL libraries (glut) for drawing images, including knowledges from CS 3GC3 and other practical online courses.

**There is an old project about 5500 lines (writen in C++ with glut library). However because of limits I cannot make it public in my github page. It is a good project and it worths everyone to have a look. Anyone who wants to see please email me directly. (It is appropriate for me to show it with HR and other recruitors.)**

### Part 1: OpenGL library basic programming works
**Introduction**: This part includes hundreds of implementations of OpenGL basic programming, each program includes one or more basic functions' usages with explanations. Some programs may include applications on computer graphics. To understand the code please read the comments on appropriate places and documentations. Each program is rendering an expected image, so each program includes a screenshot to represent expected output of image. (named output, usually JPEG format, however it may have other formats) **Before looking at contents, please read those instructions carefully.**

### Part 2: OpenGL library advanced programming works
**Introduction**: This part is a group of implementations of OpenGL advanced programming. Compared with module 1, all of techniques and tools it has are advanced programming techniques and tools. Some programs may include applications on computer graphics. To understand the code please read the comments on appropriate places and documentations. Each program is rendering an expected image, so each program includes a screenshot to represent expected output of image. (named output, usually JPEG format, however it may have other formats) **Before looking at contents, please read those instructions carefully.**

### Part 3: OpenGL Scene Rendering
**Introduction**: This part is a combinations of previous OpenGL techniques. Its expected output is a scene (rendered by OpenGL)

### Part 4: Unix Development
**Introduction**: Unix is important in today's game graphic development. This part includes a group of unix application programs.
