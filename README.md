# OpenGL-Image-Rendering
C++ project with OpenGL libraries for drawing images

**There is an old project about 5500 lines (writen in C++ with glut library). However because of limits I cannot make it public in my github page. It is a good project and it worths everyone to have a look. Anyone who wants to see please email me directly. (It is appropriate for me to show it with HR and other recruitors.)**
