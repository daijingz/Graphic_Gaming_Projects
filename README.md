# OpenGL-Image-Rendering
C++ project with OpenGL libraries for drawing images

**There is an old project about 5500 lines (writen in C++ with glut library). However because of limits I cannot make it public in my github page. It is a good project and it worths everyone to have a look. Anyone who wants to see please email me directly. (It is appropriate for me to show it with HR and other recruitors.)**

### Part 1: OpenGL library basic programming works
This part includes hundreds of implementations of OpenGL basic programming, each program includes one or more basic functions' usages with explanations. Some programs may include applications on computer graphics. To understand the code please read the comments on appropriate places and documentations. Each program is rendering an expected image, so each program includes a screenshot to represent expected output of image. (named output, usually JPEG format, however it may have other formats) **Before looking at contents, please read those instructions carefully.**

### Part 2: OpenGL library advanced programming works
This part is a group of implementations of OpenGL advanced programming. Compared with module 1, all of techniques and tools it has are advanced programming techniques and tools. Some programs may include applications on computer graphics. To understand the code please read the comments on appropriate places and documentations. Each program is rendering an expected image, so each program includes a screenshot to represent expected output of image. (named output, usually JPEG format, however it may have other formats) **Before looking at contents, please read those instructions carefully.**

### Part 3: OpenGL Scene Rendering
This part is a combinations of previous OpenGL techniques.

### Part 4: Unix gaming
Unix is important in today's game graphic development.
